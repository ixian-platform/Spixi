# Spixi

**Spixi** is a decentralized, privacy-first **communications app** built on the [Ixian Platform](https://www.ixian.io).
It combines **messaging, voice calls, file sharing, crypto wallet functionality, and Mini Apps** in a single,
cross-platform experience - with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and no central servers.

Unlike traditional messengers that rely on central servers to store keys and mediate authentication, Spixi users **hold and
control their own encryption keys locally**. Every conversation is uniquely encrypted, and identities are proven cryptographically
without passwords, central accounts, or third-party trust.

## 🚀 Why Spixi?

* ⚛️ **Post-Quantum Resistant Security** - Hybrid key exchange (`RSA + ECDH + Kyber/ML-KEM`) ensures confidentiality even against
future quantum threats.
* 🔒 **True End-to-End Encryption** - Dual encryption (AES + ChaCha20-Poly1305). Keys never leave the user's device, and each
contact-pair uses unique cryptographic keys. Only the sender and intended recipient can ever decrypt a message.
* 🧬 **Self-Authentication, Not Server Authentication** - In centralized systems, a username and password authenticate you to a
server, which then manages or even stores your keys. In Ixian, **your cryptographic address is your identity**, and you sign
messages yourself with your private key. No servers vouch for you - your identity and communication security are entirely under
your control.
* 🕸️ **Decentralized by Design** - Runs peer-to-peer over Ixian's **DLT** and **S2 overlay network**. Client discovery works
via cryptographic addresses and signed presence packets (not DNS, IP, or certificate authorities), ensuring authenticity and
privacy.
* 📱 **Cross-Platform** - Works on Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS.
* 💬 **Rich Communication** - Chat, group messaging, voice calls, reactions, emojis, and file sharing.
* 💸 **Built-In Crypto Wallet** - Send and receive IXI transactions directly inside the app.
* 🧩 **Extensible with Mini Apps** - Developers can build secure, in-app extensions and workflows within Spixi.

     dotnet restore
     ```

2. **Build and Run the Application:**
   - To build and run the application on a specific platform, use the following command:
     ```bash
     dotnet build -t:Run -f net9.0-android              # For Android
     dotnet build -t:Run -f net9.0-ios                  # For iOS
     dotnet build -t:Run -f net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0 -p:Platform=x64  # For Windows
     dotnet build -t:Run -f net9.0-maccatalyst          # For macOS
     ```
   - Ensure you have the appropriate SDKs and emulators/simulators installed for the target platform.
